Cassandra Data Migrator is an ambitious project which aims to seamlessly migrate and validate between origin and target Apache Cassandra¬Æ-compatible clusters. There are *many* ways you can contribute! Please take a moment to review this document
in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read
through it at least once if you are going to contribute to Cassandra Data Migrator.

## Licensing

All source code in this repository is licensed exclusively under
[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Jumping Right In

Some quick how-to docs have been written for some of the subject-matter
areas in Cassandra Data Migrator. If you need an onramp that is not listed, here [let us know](https://github.com/datastax/cassandra-data-migrator/issues/new)!

## Contribution Ideas

There are lots of ways to contribute to the project. Some ideas on how to
get started are described here.

### Feedback

- reporting issues - If you find an issue while using Cassandra Data Migrator, please [let us know](https://github.com/datastax/cassandra-data-migrator/issues/new)!

- reproducing issues - For some non-trivial bugs, it helps to have someone reproduce the issue.
  This can be helpful to help us understand better what conditions cause the issue to occur. If want to help
  address a non-trivial issue that has been reported, you can follow the steps that the original user
  reported. Updating issues with such findings is immensely helpful to the maintainers.

### Commits

Keep your changes **focused**. Each commit should have a single, clear purpose expressed in its 
message.

Resist the urge to "fix" cosmetic issues (add/remove blank lines, move methods, etc.) in existing
code. This adds cognitive load for reviewers, who have to figure out which changes are relevant to
the actual issue. If you see legitimate issues, like typos, address them in a separate commit (it's
fine to group multiple typo fixes in a single commit).

Commit message subjects start with a capital letter, use the imperative form and do **not** end
with a period.

Avoid catch-all messages like "Minor cleanup", "Various fixes", etc. They don't provide any useful
information to reviewers, and might be a sign that your commit contains unrelated changes.

We don't enforce a particular subject line length limit, but try to keep it short.

You can add more details after the subject line, separated by a blank line.

### Pull Requests

All contributions to this project are made in the form of pull requests, including:

- Easy Picks - Any issue labeled `easy pick` is a good first issue for new contributors. These are tagged
  by the maintainers specifically to provide a gentle on-ramp for those joining our endeavor.

- Fixing bugs - Bug fixes are awesome! If you submit a pull request with a bug fix, we will review it
  and provide feedback if refinements are needed. Otherwise we'll merge it in for the next release.

- Testing Improvements - Often, a good test is the best form of documentation. Test coverage can always
  be improved. Writing tests is also a great way to get familiar with the project up close.

- Writing documentation - Our users need good documentation. Good documentation is, however, a community
  effort. If you have used Cassandra Data Migrator and want to improve the journey for others, good documentation
  with examples is really helpful.

- Working on the core - The core machinery of Cassandra Data Migrator needs maintenance just like any code base. If you
  want to help implement new core features, manage project dependencies, address technical debt, or help
  with internal architecture, there is work to be done. This is on the more advanced end of contribution,
  and requires some study of the codebase. If you take the time to understand the code a bit before submitting
  pull requests, then the maintainers will take the time to help you make your pull requests better.

- Like commits, pull requests should be focused on a single, clearly stated goal.
  Contributors need to sign the [DataStax CLA](https://cla.datastax.com/).

### Maintainers

We are looking for more community ownership in this project. That means that we will be supportive of
new project contributors who wish to build a sense of trust with the maintainers.

- Reviewing Pull Requests - If you are a maintainer on this project, then
  you may be called on to review pull requests. Unless requested directly,
  pull requests will be allocated to reviewers automatically.

- Enforcing Conduct - You may be called up on as a maintainer of this
  project to enforce the code of conduct as it is written.

- Developing Maintainers - It is important that there be a solid core of
  project maintainers who can depend on one another and whom the project
  user base can depend on do govern the project fairly and equitably. As a
  project maintainer, you will be expected to help guide contributors as
  they learn about the project. You may be responsible for choosing
  maintainers or voting on maintainer membership.

- Documenting APIs - The developer docs are pretty lean right now. We need
  some examples of configuring and usage templates and so on. This level of 
  contribution requires an intimate awareness of how the core engine works, 
  but it is also some of the most valuable work that you can do in terms of 
  expanding the Cassandra Data Migrator ecosystem. Contributions are welcome here!


## Outreach

Help us get the word out on Cassandra Data Migrator. It is a newly opened project in its current form, and we
are eager to get it into the hands of users who need it.

- Writing blog posts - A blog post that helps others see the good in
  Cassandra Data Migrator is a service to our community. This is even better when it
  comes from a new user who has seen the merit of the tooling. We
  appreciate any help.

- Helping other users - Helping new users get to a productive state is a
  great way to build bridges in the community. The more community
  advocates we have helping each other the better!

- Community Development - The Cassandra Data Migrator project endeavors to build a
  strong, inclusive, and robust support system around users and
  contributors alike. This takes on many forms. It is essential that we
  keep looking for ways to connect the Cassandra Data Migrator community, doing more of
  what works and less of what doesn't. If you want to help with community
  development, please join our
  [discord server](https://bit.ly/cassandra-workshop) and raise your hand!
