#  This .properties file is meant to be a fairly self-documenting configuration file for a Cassandra
#  Data Migrator table migration. The document is divided into sections, with each section containing
#  a brief description of the parameters within the section, as well as a description of each parameter.
# 
#  Following the description are the parameters themselves. Parameters that are required or are otherwise
#  commonly configured have been commented in with some example values provided. Other parameters have
#  been left commented out.
#
#  Only those parameters that are commented in will be processed, any other values will either use a 
#  default value (specfied in the parameter description) or will be ignored.

# Details about the Origin Schema
# 
# Required Parameters:
#  spark.cdm.schema.origin
#    .keyspaceTable       : <keyspace>.<table_name> of the table to be migrated. Table must exist in Origin.
#
# Recommended Parameters:
#  spark.cdm.schema.origin
#    .column
#       .ttl
#          .automatic     : Default is true, unless .ttl.names is specified. When true, the TTL of the
#                           target record will be determined by finding the maxiumum TTL of
#                           all origin columns that can have TTL set (which excludes partition key,
#                           clustering key, collections/UDT/tuple, and frozen columns). When false, and
#                           .names is not set, the target record will have the TTL determined by the target
#                           table configuration.
#          .names         : Default is empty, meaning they will be determined automatically if that is set
#                           (see above). Specify a subset of eligible columns that are used to calculate
#                           the TTL of the target record.
#       .writetime
#          .automatic     : Default is true, unless .writetime.names is specified. When true, the WRITETIME of
#                           the target record will be determined by finding the maxiumum WRITETIME of
#                           all origin columns that can have WRITETIME set (which excludes partition key,
#                           clustering key, collections/UDT/tuple, and frozen columns). When false, and
#                           .names is not set, the target record will have the WRITETIME determined by the target
#                           table configuration.
#
#                           *** Note spark.cdm.transform.custom.writetime overrides this setting ***
#
#          .names         : Default is empty, meaning they will be determined automatically if that is set

#                           the WRITETIME of the target record.
#
# Other Parameters:
#  spark.cdm.schema.origin
#    .column
#       .names.to.target  : Default is empty. If column names are changed between Origin and Target, then
#                           this map-like list provides a mechanism to associate the two. The format is
#                           origin_column_name:target_column_name. The list is comma-separated. Only renamed
#                           columns need to be listed.

# Autocorrection parameters allow CDM to correct data differences found between Origin and Target when 
# running the DiffData program. Typically, these are run disabled, which will generate a list of data 
# discrepancies. The reasons for these discrepancies can then be investigated, and if necessary the
# parameters can be enabled.
# 
# Recommended Parameters:
#  spark.cdm.autocorrect
#    .missing             : Default is false. when true, data that is missing in Target but is found in 
#                           Origin will be re-migrated.
#    .mismatch            : Default is false. when true, data that is different between Origin and Target
#                           will be reconciled. It is important to note that TIMESTAMP will have an effect
#                           here - if the WRITETIME of the Origin record (determined with
#                           .writetime.indexes) is earlier than the WRITETIME of the Target record, the
#                           change will not appear in Target. This may be particularly challenging to
#                           troubleshoot if individual columns (cells) have been modified in Target.
#
# Other Parameters:
#  spark.cdm.autocorrect
#    .missing.counter     : Default is false. By default, Counter tables are not copied when missing, 
#                           unless explicitly set. This might seem an awkward thing (i.e. why not just use 
#                           .missing), but the purpose of this is to 'strongly encourage' the user to  
#                           consider what is happening. Scenario: Counter column in Target is at a value of 
#                           5323. The corresponding counter in Origin is also 5323. At some point, the Target
#                           counter gets DELETEd. Should the .missing record be re-inserted before
#                           the DELETE gets tombstoned, the counter will zombie back to life, and the
#                           counter will become 5323+5323 = 10646.
# spark.tokenRange
#   .exceptionDir         : When set partition ranges corresponding to the exceptions will be logged in
#                           file with the name <keyspace>.<table_name> in this directory.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Performance and Operations Parameters affecting throughput, error handling, and similar concerns.
# 
# Recommended Parameters:
#  spark.cdm.perfops
#    .numParts            : Defaults is 10000. In standard operation, the full token range (-2^63..2^63-1)  
#                           is divided into a number of parts which will be parallel-processed. You should 
#                           aim for each part to comprise a total of â1-10GB of data to migrate. During 
#                           intial testing, you may want this to be a small number (even 1).
#    .batchSize           : Defaults is 5. When writing to Target, this comprises the number of records that 
#                           will be put into an UNLOGGED batch. CDM will tend to work on the same partition 
#                           at a time so if your partition sizes are larger, this number may be increased. 
#                           If .batchSize would mean that more than 1 partition is often contained in a batch,  
#                           the figure should be reduced. Ideally < 1% of batches have more than 1 partition.
#    .readRateLimit       : Defaults to 20000. Concurrent number of records that may will be read across 
#                           all parallel threads. This may be adjusted up (or down), depending on the amount 
#                           of data and the processing capacity of the Origin cluster.
#    .writeRateLimit      : Defaults to 40000. Concurrent number of records that may will be written across
#                           all parallel threads. This may be adjusted up (or down), depending on the amount 
#                           of data and the processing capacity of the Target cluster.
#
# Other Parameters:
#  spark.cdm.perfops
#    .consistency         : The .consistency parameters may be one of: 
#                           ANY, ONE, TWO, THREE, QUORUM, LOCAL_ONE, EACH_QUORUM, SERIAL, LOCAL_SERIAL, ALL
#       .read             : Default is LOCAL_QUORUM. Read consistency from Origin, and also from Target 
#                           when records are read for comparison purposes.
#       .write            : Default is LOCAL_QUORUM. Write consistency to Target.
#    .fetchSizeInRows     : Default is 1000. This affects the frequency of reads from Origin, and also the 
#                           frequency of flushes to Target. 
#    .error.limit         : Default is 0. Controls how many errors a thread may encounter during MigrateData 
#                           and DiffData operations before failing. It is recommended to set this to a non-
#                           zero value only when not doing a mutation-type operation, e.g. when running 
#                           DiffData without .autocorrect.

#===========================================================================================================
# Transformation Parameters
#
#  spark.cdm.transform
#    .missing.key.ts.replace.value : Timestamp value in microseconds.
#                                    Partition and clustering columns cannot have null values, but if these
#                                    are added as part of a schema transformation between Origin and Target
#                                    it is possible that the Origin side is null. In this case, the 
#                                    MigrateData operation would fail. This parameter allows a crude 
#                                    constant value to be used in its place, separate from the Constant 
#                                    Values feature.
#   .custom
#      .writetime                    Default is 0 (diabled). Timestamp value in microseconds to use as the
#                                    WRITETIME for the target record. This is useful when the WRITETIME of
#                                    the record in Origin cannot be determined (such as the only non-key
#                                    columns are collections). This parameter allows a crude constant value
#                                    to be used in its place, and overrides
#                                    .schema.origin.column.writetime.indexes.
#      .writetime.incrementBy        Default is 0. This is useful when you have a List that is not frozen,
#                                    and are updating this via the autocorrect feature. Lists are not idempotent,
#                                    and subsequent UPSERTs would add duplicates to the list. Future versions
#                                    of CDM may tombstone the previous list, but for now this solution is
#                                    viable and, crucially, more performant.
#   .codecs                          Default is empty. A comma-separated list of additional codecs to
#                                    enable. Current codecs are:
#                                        INT_STRING                : int stored in a String

#   .names      comma-separated list of column names
#   .types      comma-separated list of column types (types as above)
#   .values     separated list of hard-coded values; the value should be as you would use on CQLSH command line
#               e.g. 'abcd' for a string, 1234 for an int, etc.
#   .splitRegex defaults to comma, but can be any regex that works with String.split(regex); this is needed
#               because some type values contain commas, e.g. lists, maps, sets, etc.

# Explode Map Feature allows you convert a source table Map into multiple target table records
#
# spark.cdm.feature.explodeMap
#   .origin.name         Name of the map column, must be on .schema.origin.column.names
#                        and the corresponding type on .schema.origin.column.types must be a map.
#   .target.name.key     Name of the column on the target table that will hold the map key. This key
#                        must be present on the Target primary key ..schema.target.column.id.names.
#   .target.name.value   Name of the column on the Target table that will hold the map value.

# Guardrail feature manages records that exceed guardrail checks. The Guardrail job will generate a
# a report, other jobs will skip records that exceed the guardrail.
#
# spark.cdm.feature.guardrail
#    .colSizeInKB        Default 0, meaning the check is not done. Records with one or more fields that
#                        exceed this size will be flagged. Note this is kB (base 10), not kiB (base 2).
